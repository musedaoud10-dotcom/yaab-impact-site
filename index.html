          <p class="eyebrow">Our mission</p>
          <h2>A Bristol where no one has to face hunger alone.</h2>
          <p>
            Rising living costs, low incomes and insecure work mean too many people in our city are having to choose between heating and eating. Food is about
            much more than survival – it’s about culture, connection and dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yaab Impact exists to make sure everyone in our communities can access healthy, affordable and culturally familiar food, in places where they feel
            welcomed and respected. We work alongside local residents, volunteers and partners to build a food system that is fairer and more resilient.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Our manifesto</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that access to good food is a basic right, not a privilege. Our work is shaped by a few simple commitments:
          </p>
          <ul class="check-list">
            <li><strong>Dignity first:</strong> people are neighbours, not numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Community led:</strong> we listen first and build with, not for.</li>
            <li><strong>Food justice:</strong> we tackle the causes of hunger, not just the symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> we share knowledge, resources and power to make change last.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every food parcel, community meal and workshop is a step towards a city where everyone can eat well and feel they belong.

            Yaab Impact is a Community Interest Company. Any surplus we create is reinvested into our work – supporting people who are most impacted by food

          <p>
            We work across neighbourhoods, supporting local groups, faith communities, schools and residents to strengthen what already exists and create new projects
            where there are gaps.
